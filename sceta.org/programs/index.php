							<h4>Programs & Outreach</h4>
							<p>
								SCETA (Southern California's Engineering Technologists Association) strives to participate in and maintain as many programs & outreach
								activities. Currently, we have one solid program under GRID Alternatives that provides our members and other volunteers of this non-profit
								organization a memorable & industry-valued experience while bringing the benefits of solar technology to communities that would not
								otherwise have access, providing needed savings for families, preparing workers & members like us for jobs in the fast-growing solar indusry,
								and helping clean our environment.
							</p>

							<h4>Innovative Tech Expo</h4>
							<p>
								For 3 years, SCETA has been hosting the Alternatives Vehicles Exposition (AV Expo) on the Cal Poly Pomona campus to spread awareness
								about the growing industry of alternative vehicles. As of 2014, SCETA is aiming to expand on the event and to give our student
								engineers bigger and better! This has led to the birth of the Innovative Tech Expo. Coming Spring 2015 on Tuesday, April 14, 2015, 
								this event will span multiple tech industries beyond alternative vehicles. There will be bigger and better vehicles plus multiple
								electronics of all sorts to further inspire our student engineers of the endless possibilities. The event will be large, so we
								would appreciate all the help we can get. Students, both members and non-members, can help volunteer for the event, and companies can 
								help with providing an exhibition to make the showcase even larger!

								<ul>
									<li>Want to showcase your awesome technology? Interested in volunteering? Have great suggestions?</li>
									<li>Please contact our development officer, Gregory Lynch, at <a href="mailto:events@sceta.org">events@sceta.org</a>.</li>
								</ul>

							<h4>GRID Alternatives</h4>

								<a href="http://gridalternatives.org/" target="_blank"><img src="http://ww1.prweb.com/prfiles/2012/04/12/9399524/GRID_logo_with_Text_Right.png"></a><br>
								GRID Alternatives is an organization that spans the entire United States and have most recently led a team to provide solar
								power to a school in Nicaragua. Our former president, Carlos Cordova, brought this program to SCETA most recently in 2012, and
								since then, the Inland Empire program has built a strong foundation into our organization's mission for providing valuable skills & 
								experiences and a strong industrial network for our members. SCETA provides about 2-3 solar installation volunteer groups composed
								of our student members every academic year, but you are always welcome to volunteer at any available time outside of our organization 
								as well. If you are interested in getting involved with SCETA, stay tuned for announcements for our next installation, and we look 
								forward to seeing you there!

							<h4>Alternative Vehicles Exposition</h4>
							<p>
								Since its inception in 2011, SCETA has been hosting the Alternative Vehicles Exposition on the Cal Poly Pomona campus to mainly spread
								awareness about the growing industry of alternative vehicles specializing in hybrid, all-electric, fuel cell, and solar cell technology.
								In addition, we aspire to inspire our student engineers about the possibilities and viability of alternative vehicles for the future and
								to make them aware that they could be the ones engineering the next generation of greener solutions in the automotive industry.
